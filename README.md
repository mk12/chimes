# Chimes

A macOS menu bar app that plays Westminster chimes every quarter hour.

## Westminster Quarters

Westminster Quarters are based on (mostly) 5 permutations of 4 notes in E major:

1. G, F, E, B
2. E, G, F, B
3. E, F, G, E ("mostly")
4. G, E, F, B
5. B, F, G, E

The bells chime as follows:

1. First quarter: P1.
2. Half hour: P2, P3.
3. Third quarter: P4, P5, P1.
4. *N*th hour: P2, P3, P4, P5. Then *N* strikes for the hour.
